ðŸ§© Process:
Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas and df.info().

Discovered the dataset doesnâ€™t contain user reviews â€” instead, I creatively used the movie descriptions (Overview) for sentiment.

Cleaned the text: removed HTML tags, stopwords, symbols, and converted everything to lowercase.

Applied TextBlobâ€™s polarity scoring to extract sentiment based on description tone.

Added polarity and subjectivity columns for deeper analysis.

Created visualizations showing sentiment distribution, polarity vs. subjectivity, and comparison with IMDB ratings.
